# Pre-migration

* Please fill in the migration questionnaire. Template is in the internal ADP documentation GitHub repository [Link].

* Once complete you will agree with the ADP Platform Team & CCoE when to be migrated and onboarded on to ADP.

# Infrastructure

ADP Portal Setup:

1. [Onboarding of delivery programme](../Getting-Started/onboarding-a-delivery-programme.md) if not present already.
2. [Onboarding of delivery project](../Getting-Started/onboarding-a-delivery-project.md)
3. [Onboarding of your team members](../Getting-Started/onboarding-a-user.md)

For each of your platform services you now need to migrate them over to ADP and create the needed infrastructure to support them. [Link to guide](migrate-a-platform-service.md).
