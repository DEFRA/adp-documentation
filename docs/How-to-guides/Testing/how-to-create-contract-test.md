## How to contract test

In this how to guide you will learn how to create, deploy, and run a contract test for a Platform service (Web App, User Interface etc) for your team.

## Prerequisites

Before adding tests for your service, you will need to ensure that:

- [Onboarded delivery project on to ADP](../../Getting-Started/onboarding-a-delivery-project.md)
- [Created a Platform Service for your team/delivery project](../../How-to-guides/Platform-Services/how-to-create-a-platform-service.md)

## Overview

By completing this guide, you will have completed these actions:

- [x] Learned how to add a contract test for your service.
- [X] Learned how to run a contract test locally.
- [X] How to customize your pipeline to run contract tests for different env.

## Guide

!!! note
    Every pipeline run includes steps to run varoious tests pre deployment and post deployment. These tests may include unit, integration, acceptance, performance, accessibilty etc as long as they are defined for the service.

    The pipeline will check for the existence of the file `./docker-compose.test.yaml` to determine if contract tests have been defined.

### How to add a contract test for your service?

The contract Test scripts should be added to the `test\contract` folder in the GitHub repository of the service. Refer to the [ffc-demo-web example](https://github.com/DEFRA/ffc-demo-web/tree/main/test/contract). This folder should contain `*.test.js` files which are required to execute the tests. Tests will be run using PACT BROKER service.

#### Requirments for local development

- Docker Desktop 2.2.0.3 (42716) or higher

### How to run a contract test locally?

Executre the above commands in bash or PowerShell

```ps1


# this will execute the docker-compose at the root folder to create an instance of the service and its dependences
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.test.yaml -p "<<servicename>>-test" up

```

### How to parameterising your Tests

#### Set required PACT Broker credentials to run tests

```shell
  export PACT_BROKER_URL="PACT Broker URL"
  export PACT_BROKER_USERNAME="PACT Broker username"
  export PACT_BROKER_PASSWORD="PACT Broker password"
```



### How to customize your pipeline to run contract tests?

You can customize the environments where you would like to run contract test (within the pipeline it is referred as integration test)

```yaml
postDeployTest:
  envToTest: snd4      
  testEnvs:
    integrationTests: snd4
  testsToRun: 'integration'
```
