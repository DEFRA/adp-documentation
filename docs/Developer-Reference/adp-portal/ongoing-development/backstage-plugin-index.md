# Backstage Plugin Index

We can extend Backstage's functionality by creating and installing plugins. Plugins can either be created by us (1st party) or we can install 3rd party plugins. The majority of 3rd party plugins are free and open source, however there are some exceptions.

This page tracks the plugins we have installed and the plugins we would like to evaluate.

## Considerations for 3rd party plugins

* **Does it bring value to the portal?** Will it help the user complete a task more easily than if the plugin had not been installed? Will it offer the user more context about a software component?
* **Is it actively maintained?** Are bugs regularly addressed? Are the maintainers responsive to new issues, pull requests, etc.
* **Is it compatible with the version of Backstage we're using?** Backstage is updated regularly and plugins need to keep up. As we maintain and update Backstage we will need to keep any plugins we're using up to date - and the more plugins we have installed the more of a headache this will be!
* **What are the licencing requirements?** Most 3rd party plugins are licensed under a FOSS licence, however there are a few commercial plugins out there for which we need a business case.
* **How does it integrate with other systems?** If the plugin needs to integrate with an external service through OAUTH, a service principal, etc what needs to be configured and what permissions does the plugin need?
